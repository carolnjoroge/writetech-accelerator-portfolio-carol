# Introduction

[Directus](https://directus.io/) is an open-source data platform and headless CMS.  
It provides a **REST and GraphQL API** layer on top of any SQL database. It acts as a bridge between the database and the front-end.

## Key Features

- **API for any database** – It auto-generates REST & GraphQL APIs.
- **Admin App** – It has a no-code content management dashboard.
- **Data modeling** – It creates, updates, and relates tables visually.
- **Extensible** – It has custom hooks, extensions, and integrations.

Directus is used for projects that need a database-driven API backend with minimal setup.
